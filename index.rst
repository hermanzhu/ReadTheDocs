 Write The Docs
================

A conference for technical writers, documentarians, and all those who
Write The Docs.

This is Version 0 of Write the Docs. There will be glitches, there
will be bugs, but we're here doing this. This is done as a community
conference: breaking even, not making money, with sponsors.

About 10 of 200 attendees have been to a documentation conference
before. Eric Holscher has been working on documentation for a while,
and was lamenting the lack of community and central resources around
writing documentation. A conference was the answer.

The job of attendees is to make friends, learn something, and build
community. This is the first WTD, so we get to set the example for the
WTD community that will [hopefully] grow around this.
